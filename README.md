# Quantum Simulation of Sulfate Aerosol Formation in the Nile Delta

🌍🇪🇬 *Hackathon Project: Dry-Run Hackathon – Advancing Egypt Through Quantum Innovation*

## 🧪 Overview

This project explores how quantum computing can model **humidity-dependent reaction kinetics** that contribute to **sulfate aerosol formation** in the Nile Delta, an area that regularly experiences humidity levels above 80%.

We simulate the **SO₂ to H₂SO₄ transformation** pathway using quantum circuits to model molecular behavior under high humidity. This project demonstrates how **quantum simulations** can support environmental monitoring and policy in Egypt.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The Nile Delta is a dense agricultural and industrial zone exposed to SO₂ emissions. High humidity accelerates the transformation of SO₂ into sulfate aerosols, negatively impacting air quality and public health. Modeling this chemically complex process with classical tools is costly and limited.

## 🎯 Objective

- Simulate the **quantum behavior of SO₂ reactions** under high humidity.
- Show how **quantum circuits** can approximate energy states and reactions.
- Explore potential for **scalable quantum solutions** for environmental chemistry.

## 🔬 Methodology

We used:
- **Qiskit (IBM)** for quantum circuit simulation.
- Quantum Hamiltonians to represent molecular energy states.
- **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** to estimate energy levels.
- Reaction pathway:  
  `SO₂ + H₂O → H₂SO₃ → H₂SO₄`

Key steps:
1. Molecule encoding (SO₂, H₂O, H₂SO₄)
2. Circuit construction for Hamiltonian simulation
3. Applying VQE algorithm for energy minimization
4. Comparison with classical simulation results
